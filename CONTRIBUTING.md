# Contributing to Project (Fix title)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Please find
some guidelines on contributions below. We seek your cooperation in
adhering to these ground rules, and welcome any feedback on our project.

## Bug Fixes and Feature Requests

If you notice a bug, or have a feature request, please open up an issue
[here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Group_7_Project/issues)
(<https://github.com/UBC-MDS/Group_7_Project/issues>).) If you do this,
do demonstrate the bug with a minimal
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex), so that we can better
understand the issue and work towards a solution.

## Pull Requests

If you'd like to not only identify a bug or request for a feature, but
would like to contribute a bug fix or a new feature, you can fork our
repository and submit a pull request. Pull requests will be reviewed
within 1 week. New code should follow the tidyverse [style
guide](http://style.tidyverse.org). You can also use the PEP8 [style
guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

## Code of Conduct

conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which all contributors must abide by. We will not entertain behaviour which violates these standards.
