# Contributing to Project (Fix title)

This outlines how to propose a change to dplyr. For more detailed info
about contributing to this, and other tidyverse packages, please see the
[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib).

### Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited
directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made
in the *source* file.

-   YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.
-   NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.

### Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an
issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem. If
you've found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug
with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

### Pull request process

-   We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request
    (PR).\
-   New code should follow the tidyverse [style
    guide](http://style.tidyverse.org). You can also use the PEP8 [style
    guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). Please do not restyle
    code that has nothing to do with your PR.
